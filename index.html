           <p>My name is Matias, I am 20 years old and I moved to Lexington 6 years ago.
            I have a dog named Beto and he is adorable. I am a junior getting a degree in ICT, as well as a minor in Business Analytics.
           </p>
           <p>I chose ICT because of the <strong>technology</strong> part of it. I have always liked using computers and I always found myself helping family members with them.</p>
           <p>I have a very happy life. I like going to the gym and learning new things. I am also a food enthusiast, and my favorite food are burritos.</p>
