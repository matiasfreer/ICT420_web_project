           <p>My name is Matias, I am 20 years old and I moved to Lexington 6 years ago from my homecountry, Costa Rica.
            <br>I am a junior getting a degree in ICT, as well as a minor in Business Analytics.
            <br>I chose ICT because of the <strong>technology</strong> part of it. I have always liked using computers and I always found myself helping family members with them.
            <br>I have a very happy life. I like going to the gym and learning new things. I am also a food enthusiast, and my favorite thing to eat are burritos.
            <br>My dog's name is Beto(Alberto) and he is an adorable mix between Australian Shepard and a Poodle.</p>
