            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            </header>
        
           <p>My name is Matias, I am 20 years old and I moved to Lexington 6 years ago from my homecountry, Costa Rica.
            <br>I am a junior getting a degree in ICT, as well as a minor in Business Analytics.
            <br>I chose ICT because of the <strong>technology</strong> part of it. I have always liked using computers and I always found myself helping family members with them.
            <br>I have a very happy life. I like going to the gym and learning new things. I am also a food enthusiast, and my favorite thing to eat are burritos.
            <br>My dog's name is Beto(Alberto) and he is an adorable mix between Australian Shepard and a Poodle.</p>

            <h3>My life in Lexington</h3>
            </header>

            <p>
            After 6 years living in Lexington, I can say I have built a very desirable life here, along with my mom and my dog.
            <br>I moved to Lexington when I was 14 years old and in the middle of the pandemic, so my life for the first 2 years was not very happy, I missed my friends and due to the pandemic, I wasn't able to make new ones.
            <br>High School was tedious, but I got through it graduating a year earlier, and from that point on, everything went uphill. I was so happy to go into college and make a new life.
            <br>Fortunately I made good friends in college and I am very happy with the career that I chose. Now that I am a Junior in college I look back and see how long I've came to be here.
            <br>Nowadays, my life is very good, I have a good school-life balance and I follow a routine that I once dreamed of.

            <h3>My life back in Costa Rica</h3>
            </header>

            <p>
            Back in my homecountry of Costa Rica, there's my family and friends, which I miss everyday. Almost everyone I know is in Costa Rica, and with time I've gotten used to that.
            <br>Every once in a while I go back and visit everyone. It always feels like I never left and I have the greatest time with the most important people.
            <br>Being in Costa Rica is like living in paradise, the weather is on point, the nature is throbbing everywhere, and people are very kind and humble.
            <br>Very often I miss little things like my grandma's cooking, or little treats or cookies I used to eat. But like I said earlier, I try to go once in a while so I get to enjoy everything I sometimes miss.
            <br>Although I don't live there anymore, Costa Rica will always be my home, and whenever I decide to go back, it will welcome me with the warmest hug.
