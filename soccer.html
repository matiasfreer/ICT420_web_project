                <h2>My history with soccer</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                Since a little kid, I have always been a soccer enthusiast. I grew up watching Messi play and he definitely made an impact in my life.
                <br>I consider him to be the GOAT of soccer, and that led me to be a die hard <strong>FC barcelona</strong> fan.
                <br>As a kid, I used to play striker and scored so many goals, my mom always tells me I was like a little Messi.
                <br>Nowadays, I like playing more in the midfield, like one of my favorite players, Pedri.
                <br>Most of my love for soccer comes from watching it. I love watching Champions League as well as the World Cup, which I'm really looking forward to.

                <h3>My favorite teams</h3>
            </header>

            <p>
                Like I mentioned earlier, I am a die hard Barcelona fan, and that will be a fact about me until I die. However, I like other teams, and sometimes I fluctuate in the teams I like.
                <br>When it comes to other teams, I like Manchester United, which I started liking when I watched Marcus Rashford play.
                <br>I also like Juventus because of their amazing defense in the past, but nowadays they are very bad.
                <br>From my homecountry I am a fan of Saprissa FC. I don't remember why I started liking them but I am pretty sure it has to do with their mascot which is a purple dragon.
                <br>Another European team I like is Paris Saint-Germain, but only because I traveled to France and bought a shirt there.

                <h3>My favorite soccer players</h3>
            </header>

            <p>
                Like any good soccer fan, of course I have a list of my favorite soccer players.
                <br>Throughout time, I have been able to see about 2 or 3 generations of soccer players go by, and I have my favorites from each era.
                <br>Also, some players I didn't get to see live but I like are Ronaldinho, Maradona, and Ronaldo Nazario. For me, that is peak soccer.
            </p>
                My top 5 favorite soccer players list is:
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lionel Messi</li>
                    <li>Marcus Rashford</li>
                    <li>Pedri Gonzalez</li>
                    <li>Lamine Yamal</li>
                    <li>Ronaldinho</li>
                </ol>
                <aside>This list is based on who I have enjoyed the most, not who I think are the best players ever.</aside>
