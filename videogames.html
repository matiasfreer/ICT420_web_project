            <p>
            I started playing videogames when I was 9 and got my first console, a PS4. Back then, I played for hours everyday
            <br>I loved playing games like Destiny, Black Ops 3, or Minecraft. That definitely marked a stage in my life that I will remember forever.
            <br>As I grew older, I played different games like Fortnite, Warzone, and Fall guys. But in 2021 a big change came, I bought my first Gaming Computer and I built it from scratch.
            <br>On my computer I have played countless games, some examples are: 
            <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Golf it!</li>
                    <li>Geometry Dash</li>
                    <li>Roblox</li>
                    <li>FIFA</li>
                    <li>The Crew 2</li>
                    <li>The Forest & Sons of The Forest</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Destiny</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                I knew about Destiny when I first bought my PS4. The PS4 came with a choice to get a free game out of the 4 that were advertised with it.
                <br>From the 4 games I only remember Destiny, and the one that I ended up getting because my dad asked me to, and that was Little Big Planet 3.
                <br>I hated LBP 3, so that is why I bought Destiny, and after playing it for a couple days, I realized I loved the game.
                <br>Out of anything I can recall from those years, playing Destiny has to be my best memory, I cannot put in words how much I liked that game.
                <br>I chose to be a titan, and I loved using the void class. Back then I wasn't financially independent, so I coulnd't buy the DLC's on my own.
                <br>However, one day my mom blessed me with a gift and that was my first DLC, which allowed me to do raids with other people, and I couldn't be happier
                <br>I played Destiny until its final days. My favorite DLC and raid was the Taken King one, which I played mostly played with my friend Leo.

                <h2>Rocket League</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                Rocket League is a special case for me because I've been playing it since it came out in 2015. I am not the best at it but I enjoy it because I play with my friends.
                <br>This game is so hard to master. There are so many mechanics and sometimes when I see professional players I just can't believe the things they do.
                <br>Since Rocket League has a competitive nature, you get put in a rank according to your skill level. I am in the diamond rank, which is a decent rank.
                <br>I remember I got Rocket League for free with my Play Station Plus membership. I like the game especially because it has not changed a single bit since the day it came out.
                <br>I think I will play rocket league even when I turn 40, only because it's such a good game and I have a great time playing with friends.
