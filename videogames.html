                I started playing videogames when I was years old and I got my first console, a PS4. Back then I played so much every day, I was addicted to games like Destiny, Black Ops 3, or Minecraft.
                <br>
                As I grew older, I played different games like Fortnite, Warzone, and Fall guys. But in 2021 a big change came, I bought my first Gaming Computer and I built it from scratch.
                <br>
                On my computer I have played countless games, some examples are: 
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Golf it!</li>
                    <li>Geometry Dash</li>
                    <li>Roblox</li>
                    <li>FIFA</li>
                    <li>The Crew 2</li>
                    <li>The Forest & Sons of The Forest</li>
                </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
        Ultimately, I can say gaming has been a big part of my life, even though with time I have stopped playing as much. My favorite game will forever be Destiny and Destiny 2, I enjoyed them so much for more than 7 <strong>amazing</strong> years.
